Boilerplate code for ruby katas
===============================

This repository is a boilerplate code for using when we are going to start a new kata in ruby.

### Getting Started

In order to use it, we must install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to run it with a container, or install a standard ruby development environment and run it in your local machine.

To run the project with docker, we can do the following:

    $ ./bin/start

Now, thanks to [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard), every time we save a change, we'll see how the tests run automatically at the terminal.
